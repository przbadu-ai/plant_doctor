## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd plant_doctor
   ```

2. **Configure Hugging Face Token**

   - Select Gemma 3n E2B (recommended) or E4B model
   - Wait for download to complete (~1.5GB)

## Usage

1. **Analyze Plant Photos**
   - Tap the camera icon
   - Take a photo or select from gallery
   - AI will analyze for diseases and provide recommendations

2. **Ask Questions**
   - Type farming-related questions in the chat
   - Get advice on plant care, treatments, and prevention

3. **View Analysis**
   - Disease identification with confidence scores
   - Severity assessment
   - Recommended treatments (organic and chemical)
   - Preventive measures

## Building Release APK

To build a release APK for Android, you need to set up code signing:

1. **Generate a keystore** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```
   Place the generated `upload-keystore.jks` file in `android/app/` directory.

2. **Create key.properties file**:
   Create a file named `key.properties` in the `android/` directory with your keystore information:
   ```properties
   storePassword=<your-keystore-password>
   keyPassword=<your-key-password>
   keyAlias=upload
   storeFile=upload-keystore.jks
   ```

3. **Build the release APK**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
   
   The signed APK will be generated at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

**Important**: Never commit your `key.properties` file or keystore files to version control. They are already included in `.gitignore`.
